### Helper code for JGI IMG demo project

This small project was made as part of the [MGM 26](https://mgm.jgi.doe.gov/attendees-agenda-26/) workshop as a way to learn about the [IMG/MER platform](https://img.jgi.doe.gov/) devoleped by the [Joint Genome Institute](https://jgi.doe.gov/) (JGI).


#### `data_img_exports`
This folder holds data set exported from IMG. Both raw exports and modified files are included here.

#### `output`
This folder holds data sets processed by R. Samples were renamed to make their treatments clear.
